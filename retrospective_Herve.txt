----LIKED----
I enjoyed working on the cash register logic in javascript.
We gave each others pointers and solutions when we could'nt figure out how to get arround a problem.
----LEARNED----
Learned a lot more about arrays!
----LACKED----
Lacked knowledge about javascript and HTML dom interraction to properly do the UI.
----LONGED FOR----
I would havd had prefer more course and time properly brainstorm and code everything.
I felt a bit time pressured.
