----LIKED----
Working on building a project and seeing things come together.
Helped each other when stuck. 
----LEARNED----
Learned a bit on how to link css, html and javascript.
----LACKED----
I lacked knowledge in Javascript and didnt feel as though there was enough time to finish putting the UI together.
----LONGED FOR----
A bit more time, still lots of Javascript catching up to do and felt as though I was really behind
